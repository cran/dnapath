\title{Summarize differential connections for a pathway}
\usage{
summarize_edges(x, alpha = NULL, monotonized = FALSE, require_dc_genes = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A 'dnapath' object from \code{\link{dnapath}}.}

\item{alpha}{Threshold for p-values of edge DC scores. If NULL,
defaults to 0.05 or the minimum possible threshold (based on the
number of permutatiosn that were run).}

\item{monotonized}{If TRUE, monotonized p-values are used.}

\item{require_dc_genes}{If TRUE, the gene-level differential connectivity
p-value of the two genes for a given edge are also considered when deciding
whether an edge is differentially connected. If neither gene is significantly
differentially connected, then the edge between them will not be either.}
}
\value{
A tibble summarizing the differential connections in
the pathway.
